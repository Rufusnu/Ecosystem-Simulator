# Ecosystem Simulator
 
The application is developed using Unity and is a simulation of an ecosystem structured using OOP concepts.

# Abstract

Ecosystem models are used to explain and analyze the system under study. Typically,
this begins as a theoretical model that depicts plausible cause-and-effect linkages
between major ecosystem components. This project presents an implementation
of the olfactory sense, on top of the sense of sight, within an ecosystem, of
independent agents with individual brain clocks and of the genetics system which
is color coded. This approach is built on classic features of ecosystem simulations in
order to outline the complex behaviours resulting from simulating both more senses
and intelligence.

A compact introduction is provided within the first chapter, Introduction 1, presenting
the motivation, the objectives and the original contributions noted above.
The second chapter, Literature review 2, is illustrating the current state of similar
ecosystem models, while in the third chapter, Theoretical Foundations 3, we are
talking about the Theory of Evolution and what pathfinding algorithms have been
used. After these three chapters, we will start to describe the solution 4 and how
the system is implemented, going through every module, marking out how the genetics,
smell and brain systems are approached in a unique way. This project is
supported by the Experimental results 5, the fifth chapter, in which we are describing
the results of a 7 hour long simulation run that also proves that biodiversity is
part of most ecosystems.
